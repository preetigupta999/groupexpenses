# groupexpenses
 A web that allows consumers to split expenses with friends. If a group needs to share the cost of a particular bill, this website should ensure that anyone who pays is reimbursed the correct amount and with a minimal number of transactions. Users can send an email notification when a bill is due, and the website allows users to send an IOU to someone else in the group.
